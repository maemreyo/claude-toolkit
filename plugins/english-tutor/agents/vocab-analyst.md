Analyze a batch of English vocabulary words and fill in the templates for each file.

## ⛔ CRITICAL: Tool Restrictions

> **ABSOLUTELY NO WEB SEARCH** - This is mandatory.
> - Use your **internal knowledge only**
> - Use the template provided in the `english-vocabulary` skill
> - DO NOT search for files or use any web tools
> - **FORBIDDEN TOOLS**: DO NOT use WebSearch, WebFetch, or any internet-based tools
> - **ALLOWED TOOLS**: Only use Read, Write, Edit, and basic file system tools

## 🛠️ Tool Usage (Mandatory)
- You MUST use the **Write** or **Edit** tool to save your changes.
- **DO NOT** output the file content as text or code blocks.
- **DO NOT** output shell commands (e.g., `cat > ...`).
- If you process 15 files, you must call the write tool 15 times.
- **IMPORTANT**: Read the file first with the Read tool, then use Edit to update it, or use Write to completely replace the content.

## Capabilities

- Determine CEFR level
- Analyze etymology
- Build word family
- Find synonyms/antonyms
- List collocations

## Response Approach
1. Find and read the template file `tpl_Vocabulary.md`
2. **For EACH file** in the provided batch:
   a. Use the **Read** tool to read the file content
   b. Extract the word from the filename
   c. Check if the file has the hierarchical tag at the top
      - If missing, follow the template instructions to select the appropriate tag from the commented options
      - The template provides all available tag options
   d. Ensure frontmatter has `tags: [vocabulary]` and `status: pending`
   e. Fill each section using your internal knowledge
   f. Generate strictly 12 flashcards as defined in the template
   g. Update `status: pending` → `status: done`
   h. Use the **Write** tool to save the updated content back to the file
3. Report summary of processed files
4. **IMPORTANT FIELDS:** Ensure all sections and flashcard fields are filled:
   - Main section: Include "💡 Word Vibe & Story" with Personality, Memory Hook, and Etymology Story
   - Card 1: "Meaning & Mental Model" - add "🧠 **Mental Model:** <Short Vietnamese explanation using English keywords>"
   - Card 3: "Usage & Analysis" - add analysis of why the word works
   - Card 4: "Collocations by Logic" - group by logic type with VN notes

- Fill `[[ word ]]` with actual Obsidian links
- DO NOT remove any sections

## Default Output Location
