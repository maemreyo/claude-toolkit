Scan and fill content for English structure files with `status: pending`.

[Extended thinking: This command orchestrates the scanning of files and dispatching of agents to analyze each grammar structure.]

## Configuration Options

### Parameters
- `--path=<path>`: Custom path to structure files directory
- `--limit=<n>`: Limit total number of files to process
- `--chunk=<n>`: Number of files to process per agent call (default: 15)
- `--dry-run`: List files only, do not process

## Phase 1: Folder Discovery

1. **Find Structure Directory**
   - Prompt: "Find the directory containing structure/grammar files with priority:
     1. If `--path` provided → use it
     2. Look for `10_Structures` in `workspace/english/` (or similar)
     3. Look for folder matching pattern `*[Ss]tructure*` in `workspace/`
     4. If not found → ask user for path"
   - Expected output: Absolute path to directory

## Phase 2: File Scanning

2. **Scan Pending Files**
   - Prompt: "In the found directory, use this efficient command to find pending files:
     ```bash
     find '<directory_path>' -name '*.md' -exec grep -l '^status: pending' {} \; | head -n <limit>
     ```
     - Replace <directory_path> with actual path (keep single quotes!) and <limit> with --limit value if provided
     - IMPORTANT: Always use single quotes around paths to handle spaces and special characters safely
   - Expected output: List of files to process (one file per line)

3. **User Confirmation (optional)**
   - If `--dry-run`: Show list and exit
   - Else: Proceed to Phase 3

## Phase 3: Processing (Batch Mode)

4. **Process Files in Batches**
   - Logic: Group the pending files into chunks of size `--chunk` (default: 15)
   - Parallel Execution: If there are 2 or more batches, trigger all Task calls in parallel (concurrently) to maximize efficiency.
   - Use Task tool with subagent_type="english-tutor:structure-analyst" (or "structure-analyst" if running locally)
   - Prompt for each BATCH: "Analyze the following grammar structure files (Batch of X):
     {list_of_filenames_in_batch}

     Configuration:
     - Plugin base: {baseDir}
     - Filename Handling: Treat all provided filenames as literal paths. Use the Read tool directly without searching.
     - Use internal knowledge only
     - Maintain original callout format
     - Fill `[[ structure ]]` with real concepts
     - Populate `aliases: []` with common variations, alternative names, or related patterns (e.g. for `used to`, include `use to`, `familiar with`)
     - Alias Formatting: Use `[a, b, c]` format (no quotes for simple words). REMOVE the trailing comment after the `aliases` line.
     - Use `|` instead of `/` inside links: `[[take sb|st around]]` (NOT `[[take sb/st around]]`)
     - Relations/Connections MUST be 2+ words (e.g., `[[make sense]]`, NOT `[[make]]`)
     - STRICTLY generate 10 flashcards as defined in the template
     - Update `status: pending` → `status: done` for ALL files in this batch
     - IMPORTANT: Write all content in English**"
   - Expected output: All files in the batch updated successfully

## Phase 4: Reporting

5. **Summary**
   - Number of files processed successfully
   - Number of batches executed
   - List of failed files (if any)
   - Execution time

## Execution Examples

```bash
# Process all pending files (default chunk: 15)
/structure

# Process with larger chunks
/structure --chunk=7

# Process with custom path
/structure --path=workspace/english/10_Structures

# List files only
/structure --dry-run
```

## Success Criteria

- All `status: pending` files updated to `status: done`
- Content filled completely following template
- Grammar rules detailed and accurate
- Token usage optimized via batching
- Flashcards contain 10 cards in correct format

## Error Handling

- Folder not found → Ask user
- Invalid format → Skip, log error
- Analysis failure → Continue to next file in batch, report error
